# Encrid Game Engine (Legacy Project)
Encrid is a 3D Game Engine for Windows and Linux.

## Context
Encrid is one of my oldest projects and my very first Game Engine, i started coding it at the year of 2010 and since then i used several technologies for it. It is also one of my most complex projects, involving a lot of Physics, Analytic Geometry, Linear Algebra and a lot of programming skills.

The first version was coded in C# and was released at Baixaki website in 2013, since then i created versions using C# (OpenGL) and C++ (OpenGL and DirectX), none of the later versions was ever released, so i gonna be releasing here some of the never released versions of Encrid.

(p.s. i was just an 11 years old kid at that time)
